'''gridplanner_skeleton.py

   This is the skeleton code for the grid planner, which will develop
   both Dijstra's and the Astar algorithms.

   PLEASE FINISH WRITING THE CODE IN THE planner() function, also
   marked by FIXME.

   When working, this will find a path in a simple 2D grid.  Feel free
   to try different grids.

#
#   To encode the graph, we also note a list of accessible neighbors.
#   And, as part of the search, we store the parent (in the tree), the
#   cost to reach this node (via the tree), and the status flags.
